# Logic-to-Visual Initiative

This folder contains work that is intentionally scoped outside the main FateForger project.

## Structure
- `spec/`
  - `logic-to-visual-platform-spec.md`
  - `logic-to-visual-platform-todo.md`
  - `d2-viewer-library.md`
- `prototype/`
  - `constraint_flow.*` prototype assets
  - `javascripts/d2-viewer/` TypeScript + runtime modules

## Scope Boundary
- Main project docs and MkDocs navigation should not depend on files in this folder.
- This folder is the staging area until a dedicated standalone repository is created.
