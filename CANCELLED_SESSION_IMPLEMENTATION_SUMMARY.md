# CANCELLED Session Logic Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the user's requested fix: **"cancelled session should not be marked complete, these should be marked cancelled, if the user does not want to plan the system should not let up. instead it should haunt to either complete it or reschedule it"**

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced PlanStatus Enum (`models.py`)
```python
class PlanStatus(Enum):
    NOT_STARTED = "NOT_STARTED"
    IN_PROGRESS = "IN_PROGRESS" 
    COMPLETE = "COMPLETE"
    CANCELLED = "CANCELLED"  # NEW: Event was cancelled, but planning still needs to be done
```

### 2. Updated Calendar Watch Server (`calendar_watch_server.py`)
- **Fixed the core business logic flaw**: Calendar event cancellations now mark sessions as `CANCELLED` (not `COMPLETE`)
- **Added 5-minute follow-up haunting**: Cancelled sessions get immediate haunting to prevent escape
- **Enhanced notification prompts**: More assertive messaging about planning requirements

Key code changes:
```python
# Before: session.status = PlanStatus.COMPLETE  # ‚ùå WRONG - let users escape
# After:
session.status = PlanStatus.CANCELLED  # ‚úÖ CORRECT - prevents escape
logger.info(f"Session {session.id} marked as CANCELLED due to event cancellation")

# Schedule immediate follow-up haunting (5 minutes)
haunt_time = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(minutes=5)
job_id = schedule_user_haunt(session.id, haunt_time)
```

### 3. Enhanced Haunter Bot Logic (`haunter_bot.py`)
- **CANCELLED status handling**: Continues haunting with escalating persistent messages
- **Specialized messaging**: Different, more assertive prompts for CANCELLED sessions
- **Prevents escape**: Only `COMPLETE` status stops haunting, not `CANCELLED`

Key haunting messages for CANCELLED sessions:
- **Attempt 0**: "üëª ‚ùå Your planning event was cancelled, but the planning work STILL needs to be done!"
- **Attempt 1**: "üëª ‚ö†Ô∏è Just because your calendar event was cancelled doesn't mean you can skip planning!"
- **Attempt 2**: "üëª üö® This is attempt #3 - You CANNOT escape planning by cancelling calendar events."
- **Attempt 3+**: "üëª üíÄ PERSISTENT REMINDER #N: Planning is not optional! Your cancelled event doesn't change that."

## Business Logic Flow

### Before (‚ùå Broken)
1. User schedules planning session
2. User cancels calendar event  
3. System marks session as `COMPLETE` 
4. **User escapes planning requirements** ‚Üê PROBLEM
5. No more haunting occurs

### After (‚úÖ Fixed)  
1. User schedules planning session
2. User cancels calendar event
3. System marks session as `CANCELLED` 
4. **5-minute follow-up haunting scheduled**
5. **Persistent haunting with escalating messages**
6. User must either:
   - Reschedule the planning session, OR
   - Complete the planning work
7. Only marking as `COMPLETE` stops haunting

## Validation Results ‚úÖ

All requirements successfully implemented and tested:

### ‚úÖ Core Requirements Met
- **"cancelled session should not be marked complete"** ‚Üí Sessions marked as `CANCELLED`, not `COMPLETE`
- **"these should be marked cancelled"** ‚Üí `PlanStatus.CANCELLED` enum value added and used
- **"system should not let up"** ‚Üí Continuous haunting for `CANCELLED` sessions  
- **"haunt to either complete it or reschedule it"** ‚Üí Messages explicitly mention both options

### ‚úÖ Technical Implementation
- Calendar event cancellation properly detected and handled
- Database schema supports `CANCELLED` status
- Haunter bot logic differentiates between statuses
- Message escalation provides increasing pressure
- Only `COMPLETE` status stops the haunting system

### ‚úÖ User Experience
- Clear messaging about why planning is still required
- Escalating pressure to prevent procrastination
- Options provided: reschedule OR complete planning
- No way to "escape" planning through calendar manipulation

## Impact

**Problem Solved**: Users can no longer avoid their planning responsibilities by simply cancelling calendar events. The system now properly enforces planning completion through persistent, escalating reminders until the user either reschedules or completes their planning work.

**User Behavior Change**: Forces accountability - users must explicitly choose to complete planning or reschedule, rather than being allowed to "accidentally" skip planning through event cancellation.

## Files Modified

1. `src/productivity_bot/models.py` - Added `CANCELLED` status to enum
2. `src/productivity_bot/calendar_watch_server.py` - Fixed cancellation logic and added follow-up haunting  
3. `src/productivity_bot/haunter_bot.py` - Enhanced to handle `CANCELLED` sessions with persistent messaging

## Testing

Created comprehensive validation script (`validate_cancelled_logic.py`) that confirms:
- ‚úÖ Cancelled events trigger `CANCELLED` status (not `COMPLETE`)
- ‚úÖ Haunter bot continues haunting `CANCELLED` sessions
- ‚úÖ Escalating messages emphasize planning requirement  
- ‚úÖ Only `COMPLETE` status stops haunting
- ‚úÖ Business logic prevents planning escape through cancellation

**All tests pass** - the implementation correctly addresses the user's feedback and prevents the planning requirement bypass.
