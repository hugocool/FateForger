# Notion Adapter

Notion integration helpers for timeboxing preferences.

Key files:
- `timeboxing_preferences.py`: durable preference storage.

## Status
- `Implemented`: durable Notion constraint store is in active use via MCP.
- `WIP`: schema compatibility handling for legacy `TB Constraints` properties (e.g. duration field attribute aliases) is being stabilized.
