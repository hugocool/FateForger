# Progress (Updated: 2025-08-13)

## Done

- Identified exact cause of AutoGen runtime hanging: missing runtime.start() and incorrect AgentId format
- Fixed hanging issue - runtime now works with correct AgentId('planner_agent', 'default') and runtime.start()

## Doing



## Next

- Test timeboxing workflow with working AutoGen runtime
- Integrate calendar MCP tools with the working planner agent
