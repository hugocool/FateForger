## Current Goals

- Successfully implemented user's improved approach for CalendarEvent model: using nested Pydantic models (CreatorOrganizer, EventDateTime) with sa_column=Column(JSON) instead of raw Dict types. This provides full type safety, validation, and IDE auto-completion while storing efficiently as JSON. Also renamed remote_event_id to google_event_id for clarity.

## USER'S EXPLICIT ARCHITECTURAL CHOICES:
1. **‚úÖ USE AUTOGEN AssistantAgent** - NOT custom classes, NOT simple agents
2. **‚úÖ USE AUTOGEN'S MCP INTEGRATION** - NOT manual HTTP calls, NOT direct REST API
3. **‚úÖ USE MCP WORKBENCH** - The user insisted "no bypassing, you are going to use MCP workbench whether you like it or not"
4. **‚úÖ CONNECT TO REAL CALENDAR DATA** - NOT mock data, NOT fake events
5. **‚úÖ NO HANGING** - All operations must have timeouts

## üö´ FORBIDDEN SOLUTIONS:
- ‚ùå Manual HTTP requests to MCP server
- ‚ùå Custom agent classes instead of AutoGen AssistantAgent  
- ‚ùå Mock/fake data when user wants real calendar events
- ‚ùå Bypassing AutoGen MCP system with "simpler" alternatives
- ‚ùå Suggesting different frameworks than what user chose


## Current Blockers

- MCP server connection issues - need to ensure the server is running and accessible
