    "# Issue 23 Memory Model + UI Transparency\n",

    "- Status: WIP\n",
    "- Owner: Codex + Hugo\n",
    "- Issue: https://github.com/hugocool/FateForger/issues/23\n",
    "- Branch: issue/23-timeboxing-memory-model-ui-transparency\n",
    "- PR: TBD\n",
    "- Acceptance Criteria: issue #23 body (memory visibility, suppression, precedence, durable always, tests)\n",
    "- Last clean run: 2026-02-28 (.venv, Python 3.11.9)\n",
    "- Repo cleanliness snapshot: clean (git status --porcelain, 2026-02-28 UTC)\n"

    "\n",
    "Problem\n",
    "- Implement and validate issue #23 memory transparency and control features from mainline baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints\n",
    "- Preserve stage flow responsiveness; no blocking durable writes in user turn path.\n",
    "- Keep GitHub as execution source of truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsibilities\n",
    "- Timeboxing coordinator owns memory assembly/selection and session suppression.\n",
    "- Slack surface exposes memory review/edit controls and visibility labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approval note\n",
    "- User approved #23 scope and requested direct implementation from main baseline.\n"

    "Option A: Incremental extension of current memory review/list flow (recommended)\n",
    "- Add missing labels/fields and suppression controls on existing typed memory result path.\n",
    "- Keep stage routing and store adapters unchanged except for required metadata additions.\n",
    "- Risk: some UI constraints in existing blocks may require careful compact formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option B: New dedicated memory panel subsystem\n",
    "- Build separate Slack view/action path for memory panel with independent state model.\n",
    "- Risk: larger scope and duplicate logic with existing memory review tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended path\n",
    "- Option A: fastest to AC with least behavior risk and best reuse.\n"
