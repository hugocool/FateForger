# WIP Notebooks

Human index for active notebook work.

## Purpose

- This folder contains notebooks linked to active GitHub issues/PRs.
- Notebooks here are allowed to be incomplete while iterating.

## Expectations

- Each notebook should map to one active issue branch.
- First markdown cell should include workflow metadata (status, owner, issue, PR, last clean run).
- Stable logic should be extracted into `src/`, `tests/`, and docs before moving to `notebooks/DONE/`.
