    "\n",
    "- Problem to solve: reduce ambiguity by forcing chat-first design alignment before notebook/code implementation.\n",

    "  - notebook-mode should be a real pairing surface, not only traceability metadata\n",
    "  - human confirms direction before major coding\n",
    "  - workflow remains GitHub-first for execution tracking\n",
    "- Responsibility split:\n",
    "  - Human: confirms problem framing, constraints, ownership boundaries, and chosen direction.\n",
    "  - Agent: proposes options/tradeoffs/pseudocode, writes confirmed plan to notebook, executes modular implementation.\n",
    "- Selected direction:\n",
    "  - Add mandatory chat-first intake and design-options confirmation in workflow instructions.\n",
    "  - Persist confirmed decisions in notebook before major coding.\n",
    "- Open questions:\n",
    "  - Preferred template verbosity for future `Pairing Intake Record` sections (short vs detailed).\n"

    "## Design Options (Pre-Implementation Handshake)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A (Recommended): Stage-local incremental extension\n",
    "- Keep existing node boundaries and add focused fields/handlers.\n",
    "- Tradeoff: Lowest risk and easiest review, but extends current flow complexity.\n",
    "- Risks: state-flag drift unless tests are strong.\n",
    "- Pseudocode outline:\n",
    "  - capture stage -> if prerequisites ready: start skeleton pregen task\n",
    "  - skeleton stage -> consume pregen result else fallback sync generation\n",
    "  - review stage -> set pending_submit and emit confirm/cancel controls\n",
    "  - confirm action -> submit, persist sync transaction, emit undo control\n",
    "  - undo action -> undo last transaction, restore base snapshot, return refine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B: Dedicated submission coordinator service\n",
    "- Introduce service object coordinating submit/undo/pending state outside nodes.\n",
    "- Tradeoff: clearer separation and future extensibility, but bigger refactor scope.\n",
    "- Risks: touches more files/interfaces; higher regression risk for this ticket.\n",
    "- Pseudocode outline:\n",
    "  - coordinator.start_review(session) -> pending token + actions payload\n",
    "  - coordinator.confirm(token) -> submit + store tx + post-submit payload\n",
    "  - coordinator.undo(token) -> rollback + restore session snapshot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option C: Event-log-first state machine\n",
    "- Model submit/undo as append-only events and derive session state from log.\n",
    "- Tradeoff: strongest determinism/auditability, highest implementation cost now.\n",
    "- Risks: over-engineering for current scope.\n",
    "- Pseudocode outline:\n",
    "  - append event(REVIEW_READY)\n",
    "  - append event(SUBMIT_CONFIRMED, tx)\n",
    "  - append event(UNDO_CONFIRMED, tx)\n",
    "  - derive pending/committed/undone from replay\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Option\n",
    "- Selected: Option A\n",
    "- Why: fits ticket scope AC1-AC5 with minimal churn and strong testability.\n"
