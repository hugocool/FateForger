    "## Pairing Intake Record\n",
    "- Confirmed problem: calendar sync emits duplicate creates for events that already exist remotely.\n",
    "- Constraints: preserve no-touch policy for foreign events; no TBPatch schema changes; no deterministic NLU additions.\n",
    "- Ownership split: reconciliation and sync ops in `src/fateforger/agents/timeboxing`; tests in `tests/unit`; this notebook is evidence/workbench.\n",
    "- Selected direction: explicit remote/desired reconciliation producing calendar ops.\n",
    "- Unresolved questions: none at kickoff.\n"

    "## Design Options\n",
    "### Option A (Recommended): Explicit reconciliation records + deterministic matching\n",
    "- Build `calendar_reconciliation.py` with typed records and pass-based matching (ID, exact canonical, conservative fallback).\n",
    "- Generate `create/update/delete/noop/skip` from matched/unmatched sets.\n",
    "- Use DeepDiff only for matched pair field deltas.\n",
    "- Risk: moderate code movement, but highest correctness/traceability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B: Patch existing `summary|start` key map\n",
    "- Keep current map and add more guardrails.\n",
    "- Risk: identity remains lossy; duplicate edge cases likely persist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option C: Heuristic-only fuzzy matching\n",
    "- Skip lineage/canonical primary matching and rely on fuzzy overlap/title scoring.\n",
    "- Risk: unstable matching and accidental remote mutations.\n"
