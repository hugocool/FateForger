# Feature Notebooks

## Purpose

- This folder stores retained feature/design notebooks kept as references.
- These notebooks are not the production source of truth.

## Status

- **Documented** (2026-02-13): `gradio_chat.ipynb` moved here as reference material (not active issue work).

## Expectations

- Prefer `Reference` or `Archived` status labels in notebook metadata.
- If code becomes durable behavior, extract it to `src/` and `tests/`.
- Keep notebook explanations concise and update `notebooks/README.md` when adding or retiring files.
