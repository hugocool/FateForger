   - AI-powered daily plan generation using AutoGen framework
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for calendar operations
   - Intelligent schedule optimization and time-boxing suggestions
   - Context-aware recommendations based on calendar availability

2. **MCP Calendar Tool** (within autogen_planner.py)
   - Interface for calendar operations via MCP server at `http://mcp:4000`
   - Event listing, availability analysis, and conflict detection
   - Time slot calculation with work hours and break preferences
   - Event creation capabilities (prepared for future use)

3. **PlannerBot Integration Enhancement**

   - Automatic AI plan enhancement after planning session creation
   - Follow-up Slack messages with AI suggestions and action buttons
   - Seamless integration with haunter scheduling system

### Integration Flow

The complete end-to-end flow now works as follows:

```
User fills planning modal → PlanningSession created → AutoGen enhances plan
                    ↓
Slack AI suggestions sent ← MCP calendar analyzed ← Available slots calculated
                    ↓
Haunter reminders scheduled → Exponential back-off → Persistent follow-up
```
